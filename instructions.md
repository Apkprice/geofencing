**Step 1: Obtain a Google Maps API Key**

1.  Go to the Google Cloud Platform.
2.  Sign in with your Google account.
3.  Create a new project by clicking the **Select a project** dropdown and then selecting **New Project**.
    *   Give your project a name and click **Create**.
4.  In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **APIs & Services** → **Library**.
5.  Search for and enable the **Maps JavaScript API**.
6.  Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**.
7.  Click **\+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** and select **API Key**.
    *   This will generate an API key. Copy this key as you’ll need it in the JavaScript code.
8.  (Optional) You can set restrictions on your API key to prevent unauthorized use:
    *   Click on the API key to edit it.
    *   Set **Application restrictions** to HTTP referrers if you want to allow only your website to use this key.
    *   Set **API restrictions** to only allow **Maps JavaScript API** access.

**Step 2: Update the HTML and JavaScript Code**

Replace the placeholder YOUR\_API\_KEY with your actual API key obtained from Step 1.

#### **Step 3: Check Your JavaScript Console**

If the page still does not load correctly, open your browser's JavaScript console:

*   **Chrome**: Right-click the page → Inspect → Console.
*   **Firefox**: Right-click the page → Inspect Element → Console.
*   **Edge**: Right-click the page → Inspect Element → Console.

Common errors include:

*   **Invalid API Key**: Make sure you've pasted the correct key.
*   **API Not Enabled**: Make sure the **Maps JavaScript API** is enabled in your Google Cloud project.
*   **Billing Issue**: Ensure that your Google Cloud account has billing enabled (this is required even for the free tier).

#### **Step 4: Host the HTML File Locally or on a Server**

1.  Save the HTML code as an index.html file.
2.  Host the file using a simple local web server. If you’re familiar with Python, you can use its built-in web server:
    *   Open a terminal/command prompt.
    *   Navigate to the directory where your index.html file is located.
    *   Run the following command to start a local server: **python -m http.server 8000**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.

#### **Step 5: Test the Implementation**

*   Open the page in your web browser and check if the map loads correctly.
*   Verify that the alert triggers when the user's location is within the defined geofence.
*   If you’re still facing issues, check the JavaScript console for specific error messages and debug accordingly.

### Troubleshooting Tips

*   **API Key Restrictions**: Make sure that any restrictions you set on your API key match your setup. If you restricted it to specific HTTP referrers, ensure the URL matches exactly.
*   **HTTP vs HTTPS**: Google Maps API requires your site to be HTTPS for production use, although localhost is usually exempt from this restriction.
*   **Check Browser Compatibility**: Make sure the browser you're using supports the Google Maps API (recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc., usually work).
