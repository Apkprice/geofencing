# Geofencing
This repository holds the code and explaination along with the full scope of idea of geofencing, its connection to cybersecurity and privacy of users.

In my technical blog on Geofencing, I explore this location-based technology and its dual impact on marketing and cybersecurity. Geofencing creates a virtual boundary around specific areas, allowing businesses to send targeted messages to users who enter those zones, enhancing marketing precision. While it offers convenience, it also raises significant privacy concerns, as it involves the collection of detailed user data. My blog dives into how this data is used, potential risks, and how attackers might exploit vulnerabilities. I provide practical JavaScript code to simulate geofencing, demonstrating its functionality. To protect privacy, I also offer actionable cybersecurity tips, like managing location permissions and using VPNs. The blog blends theory with hands-on examples to empower readers with a deeper understanding and the tools to safeguard their privacy.
